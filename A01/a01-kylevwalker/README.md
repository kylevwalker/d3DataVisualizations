## Notes

**HOW TO RUN:**

Simply load the index.html page in a compatible browser. The html is validated and contains a separate CSS style sheet.
Downloading the index.html and associated style.css file into the same directory and previewing the index.html in your preferred browser
should yield expected results.

**OTHER INFO:**

This html was tested using Brave browser, which runs on the Chromium engine used by Google Chrome.


## Included files

* README.md -- this file
* index.html -- main html file containing all SVG elements and contents displayed in browser
* style.css -- separate CSS style sheet used for style and colors of html contents, so no style depends on html
