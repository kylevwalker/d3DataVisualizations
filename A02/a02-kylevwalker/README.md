## Notes
To test this code, download the zipped file and open the index.html in your default browser. My testing was done on Brave Browser (Chromium). I added Axis with labels for extra credit, including grid lines, labels, clean rounding numbers, padding, aligned text and accurate positioning. All functions are modular so parameters can easily be changed to test new combinations of visuals.


## Included files

* index.html - Base html which contains divs populated by A02 for viewing data in browser.
* a02.js - Main Javascript file that processes data and populates HTML document with procedurally generated scatterplot graphics.
* scores.js - Javascript array conversion of CSV data used in visualization, representing SATV, SATM, ACT, and GPA scores of seniors from Calvin College in 2004.
* svg.js - Javascript functions used in creating SVG elements and plotting data in SVGs. Emulates similar syntax to D3 but is used as helper functions for plotting in a02.js
