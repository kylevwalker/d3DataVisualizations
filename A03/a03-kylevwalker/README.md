## Notes
To test this program, simply download the zip and open index.html in default browser. Mine was tested in Brave Browser (Chromium). All parameters are already set, so the visualizations will automatically load in this order:
1) Chart 1 from iteration_8.js by Joshua Levine
2) Chart 2 from iteration_8.js by Joshua Levine
3) Chart 3 from iteration_8.js by Joshua Levine
4) ScatterPlot 2 from a02,js by me

All visualization parameters and helper functions used in recreating charts 1-3 are copied from J. Levine's iteration_8.js for most accurate recreations.
