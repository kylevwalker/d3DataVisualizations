## Notes
This program shows two scatterplots of differet attributes from the same dataset and allows user interaction for more specific comparisons. To run, download and extract zip and open the index.html file in default browser. Code tested on Brave Browser (Chromium).

To interact with data, select individual points or drag to create brush selections. Selecting individual points shows specific info in the html table and shows the linked point on the other plot. Create brush selections on both plots and drag along different areas to view overlapping data.
